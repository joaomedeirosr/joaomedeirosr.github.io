I am a Master's student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/) at [Unicamp](https://unicamp.br/) and a Research Assistant at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/). I earned my Bachelor's degree at the [Federal University of Uberlandia](https://ufu.br/).

Currently, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Bem Agro](https://www.bemagro.com/).

My research interests:
- reinforcement learning
- imitation learning
- humanoid and legged robots
- machine learning and computer vision

My research focuses on learning-based methods for humanoid and legged robots, with an emphasis on reinforcement and imitation learning for robust perception and control. I am interested in systems that can act safely and reliably in the real world.

If you have any questions about my research or want to collaborate, feel free to contact me anytime.
